# Recipe 4

**Name**: Beef And Broccoli Stir-Fry

**Description**: Itâ€™s your favorite take-out dish, but made exactly to your liking. And just like the classic Chinese-American dish, this recipe works great as leftovers when reheated in a microwave or over the stove. If you want to freshen it up, just chop up and throw in whatever vegetables you have in the fridge, like onions, bell peppers, or even water chestnuts.
