**Name**: Low-Carb Mediterranean Chicken And Tomato By Kevin Curry

**Description**: Kevin Curry of @fitmencook shows us how to make one of his favorite keto-friendly dishes. Sear off chicken thighs and then stir up a creamy sun-dried tomato sauce, all in the same pan! Feel free to customize this recipe to your own liking by swapping out the chicken thighs for chicken breasts or shrimp and using light coconut milk instead of heavy cream.
