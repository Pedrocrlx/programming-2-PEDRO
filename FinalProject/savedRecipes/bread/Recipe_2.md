**Name**: Grilled Cheese

**Description**: The secret to a perfect grilled cheese recipe? Mayonnaise! (No, really, it makes the outside crispier and tangier.) Spread butter on one side of each bread slice and mayo on the other. Sandwich the cheddar slices between the buttered sides, leaving the mayo sides on the outside. Fry for a few minutes until golden, dip into a bowl of tomato soup, and resolve to never make a grilled cheese without mayo ever again!
